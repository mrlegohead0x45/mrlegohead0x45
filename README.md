Hi, I'm mrlegohead0x45

I mainly write in Python, and sometimes C++ and I would like to learn Rust.
I am also interested in cybersecurity and sometimes I participate in CTFs
(although I am not yet in a team - if you want to invite me, feel free, I'm on [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/user/108672)).
I am studying GCSE Computer Science and next year I will be doing A Level CS, Physics, Maths and Further Maths

Some projects of mine that I think you should check out:
- [pathsearch](https://github.com/mrlegohead0x45/pathsearch) (which is on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pathsearch/))

If you want to collaborate on any projects, you can contact me here on GitHub, or email me at
mrlegohead0x45@gmail.com

This repository should also contain my public key which any release files I create should be signed with.
